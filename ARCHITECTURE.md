# Field GenAI MCP - Architecture Design

## Overview
An intelligent document processing system that uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) to enable AI-powered multi-document management, intelligent file selection, and conversational interaction for form field extraction.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Upload Interface**: Multi-file upload with Uploadcare integration
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time conversational UI with Gemini
- **Form Display**: Dynamic form population based on AI extraction
- **Document Manager**: View/manage uploaded documents

### 2. MCP Server Layer
The MCP server acts as an intelligent middleware that:
- **Exposes uploaded files** to the AI chat interface
- **Manages file metadata** and indexing
- **Provides context** about available documents
- **Enables file operations** (read, analyze, compare)

### 3. Storage Layer
- **Uploadcare**: Primary storage for uploaded documents
- **Alternative**: S3-compatible storage (MinIO, AWS S3, etc.)
- **Local Cache**: Temporary storage for processing

### 4. AI Services
- **Google Gemini**: Conversational AI for chat interface
- **Document AI**: OCR and document understanding
- **Embeddings**: For semantic document search

## Key Features & Workflow

### Phase 1: Multi-Document Upload
```
User → Uploads multiple documents → Uploadcare → MCP indexes files
```

### Phase 2: Intelligent Chat Interaction
```
User asks: "I need to fill out a contact form, can you find the right document?"
↓
Gemini (via MCP) → Analyzes all uploaded documents
↓
AI Response: "I found 3 potential documents. The invoice from ACME Corp
contains Michael Chen's contact details. Should I use this one?"
↓
User confirms → AI extracts fields → Populates form
```

## MCP Server Capabilities

### Tools/Functions the MCP Server Will Expose:

1. **list_documents**
   - Returns all uploaded documents with metadata
   - Includes: filename, type, size, upload date, brief content preview

2. **read_document**
   - Reads specific document content
   - Supports: PDF, images, text files

3. **search_documents**
   - Semantic search across all documents
   - Finds documents containing specific information

4. **analyze_document**
   - Extracts structured data from a document
   - Returns: detected fields, entities, key information

5. **compare_documents**
   - Compares multiple documents
   - Identifies which has the most complete information

## Why MCP is Perfect for This Use Case

1. **Protocol Standardization**: MCP provides a standard way for AI to interact with external tools/files
2. **Context Management**: Efficiently manages context across multiple documents
3. **Tool Calling**: Native support for AI to call functions (search, read, analyze)
4. **Streaming**: Real-time updates as documents are processed
5. **Security**: Built-in authentication and permission management

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 15
- React 19
- Mantine UI
- Uploadcare React Widget
- Socket.io (for real-time chat)

### Backend
- tRPC (existing API layer)
- MCP Server (Node.js)
- Express/Fastify for MCP HTTP transport

### Storage
- Uploadcare API
- Redis (for caching and sessions)

### AI Services
- Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (chat)
- Google Document AI (OCR)
- Google Vertex AI (embeddings)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic MCP Server
- Set up MCP server with file listing
- Connect to Uploadcare
- Basic tool implementations

### Phase 2: Chat Integration
- Integrate Gemini with MCP tools
- Build conversational UI
- Implement file selection logic

### Phase 3: Intelligent Processing
- Add semantic search
- Implement document comparison
- Smart field extraction

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Multi-user support
- Document versioning
- Batch processing
- Export capabilities

## Example User Journey

1. **Upload Phase**
   - User uploads 10 documents (invoices, contracts, forms, receipts)
   - System indexes all documents via MCP

2. **Discovery Phase**
   - User: "I need to fill out a vendor form"
   - AI: "I found several documents. Let me analyze them..."
   - AI: "The invoice from TechCorp has the most complete vendor information"

3. **Extraction Phase**
   - User: "Yes, use that one"
   - AI extracts: Company name, address, tax ID, contact person, etc.
   - Form is auto-populated

4. **Refinement Phase**
   - User: "Can you also find their banking details?"
   - AI searches other documents
   - AI: "I found banking details in the contract document"
   - Additional fields populated

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Intelligent File Selection**: AI can understand context and automatically select the right document
2. **No Manual Navigation**: Users don't need to specify which file contains what
3. **Multi-Document Context**: AI can combine information from multiple documents
4. **Conversational Interface**: Natural language interaction instead of clicking through files
5. **Scalable**: Can handle hundreds of documents efficiently
6. **Extensible**: Easy to add new storage providers or AI capabilities

## Security Considerations

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive documents
- User authentication and authorization
- Secure MCP server communication
- Data retention policies
- GDPR compliance for personal data

## Next Steps

1. Set up Uploadcare account and API keys
2. Initialize MCP server project
3. Implement basic tools (list, read)
4. Integrate Gemini for chat
5. Build UI components
6. Test with sample documents
